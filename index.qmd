## Our Motivation

As Macalester College students, we are constantly surrounded by the trees on campus.
Walking to and from classes, meetings, and practices, it is hard to miss the 953 different trees around campus.
Each tree has its own story and we wanted to dive deeper into them and explore.
Understanding how the trees are planted around campus, the different species present, as well as their sizes are all things that we wanted to explore.
In this project, the questions we are exploring are:

##### ***What species of trees are planted around Macalester's campus?***

##### ***What is the relationship between species and diameter?***

##### ***Are there patterns in how species are planted?***

## Background on the Data

-   Where did we get it? Who created it? What was included?

We researched nature topics specifically related to Macalester so that we could learn more about our campus and the outdoors, and found this amazing shared drive created by AIDAN REYNOLDS (â€˜25) AND THE MACALESTER SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE that included two main files a CSV and a shape file.

## Summary Statistics

-   What does some of the Data preliminarily look like? To begin we wanted to know what the most common tree species were on campus and did Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to get to know our data.

Result: The top 10 most common tree SPECIES on campus are :

**Top 10 Common Trees - Table**

| Species        | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| White spruce   | 100   |
| Crabapple      | 78    |
| Silver maple   | 66    |
| Hackberry      | 65    |
| Sugar maple    | 64    |
| Honey locust   | 55    |
| Norway maple   | 54    |
| American elm   | 31    |
| Red maple      | 31    |
| Eastern redbud | 27    |

This then lead us to wonder...

Why is it that these trees are most common on campus?
100 White spruce trees is a lot of one tree.
Does the sizing of the trees play any role in this?
Is it possible that if a tree species is very small than it could skew the number of them that are planted on campus because they take up lots of or very little room?

So with these questions in mind we than explored more about the tree species diameters.
First looking at all of the data and than narrowing in on the top most common 9 species and their diameters.

-   Shay's plot

I created this plot to examine if there was a correlation between these two aspect (species and diameter) on campus.

```{r}
ggplot(sum_top_9_long,aes(x= SPECIES, y = Diameter, fill = Type))+
  geom_col(position = position_dodge())+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title ="Campus Trees Diameter by Species", x = "Species (top 9)", y = "Diameter at Breast Height (inches)", fill = "Measurement Type", caption = "Data from Macalester Tree Inventory Drive (LAST UPDATED JULY 2024)")+
  theme_minimal()
fig.alt = "Here is a bar graph that on the y-axis shows the top 9 most common species on campus bottom being the most common and top being the least common of the 9 pictured. Then across the x-axis is the trees diameter at breast height in inches. Each species has three individual bars for each diameter measurement smallest, average, largest within their species to try and give a sumamry of how their diameters range."
```

-   Explanation and Exploration of the data and species?

-   What do we learn?

-   What further questions does this lead to?

## Across Campus

<img src="Picture3.jpeg" height="500px"/>

After exploring these diameters and the relations to the species we wanted to learn more about how species are planted across campus.
To do this we wanted to explore the trees in their place and positioning around Macalester's campus.
As shown in the map below, Trees are planted across Macalester's campus - the map displays the trees on campus and if you hover over each the species will be shown.
Additionally, if you want to explore by species further, you can select each of the Top 9 species you want to see and each has a different color.

:::

Seeing all the trees on campus and their various species, we learn that there are some patterns.
Certain species appear to be planted more around campus while others are very spread out without patterns.
There are so, so many different species of trees planted around campus, which is so cool.
The boundaries of campus are lined with trees.
Continuing this exploration it would be interesting to explore when various trees were planted, and see if there are further patterns!

## Limitations and Future Work

-   Work could benefit from exploring tree species specific traits.

-   Work could benefit if more data was available (tree age, tree health, tree height)

-   Work could benefit from understanding Macalester tree species patterns vs Minnesota as a state.
