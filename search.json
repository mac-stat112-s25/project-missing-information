    "text": "Our Motivation\nAs Macalester College students, we are constantly surrounded by the trees on campus. Walking to and from classes, meetings, and practices, it is hard to miss the 953 different trees around campus. Each tree has its own story and we wanted to dive deeper into them and explore. Understanding how the trees are planted around campus, the different species present, as well as their sizes are all things that we wanted to explore. In this project, the questions we are exploring are:\nWhat species of trees are planted around Macalester’s campus?\nWhat is the relationship between species and diameter?\nAre there patterns in how species are planted?",

What was included?\n\nWe researched nature topics specifically related to Macalester so that we could learn more about our campus and the outdoors, and found this amazing shared drive created by AIDAN REYNOLDS (’25) AND THE MACALESTER SUSTAINABILITY OFFICE that included two main files: a CSV and a shape file.\nMacalester Trees Inventory (Shared Google Drive) Click here to vist the drive!",

    "text": "Summary Statistics\n\nWhat does some of the Data preliminarily look like? To begin we wanted to know what the most common tree species were on campus and did Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to get to know our data.\n\nResult: The top 10 most common tree SPECIES on campus are :\nTop 10 Common Trees - Table\n\n\nSpecies\nCount\n\n\n\nWhite spruce\n100\n\n\nCrabapple\n78\n\n\nSilver maple\n66\n\n\nHackberry\n65\n\n\nSugar maple\n64\n\n\nHoney locust\n55\n\n\nNorway maple\n54\n\n\nAmerican elm\n31\n\n\nRed maple\n31\n\n\nEastern redbud\n27\n\n\n\nThis then lead us to wonder…\nWhy is it that these trees are most common on campus? One-hundred White spruce trees is a lot of one tree. Does the sizing of the trees play any role in this? Is it possible that if a tree species is very small that it could skew the number of them that are planted on campus because they take up lots of or very little room?\nSo with these questions in mind we than explored more about the tree species diameters. First looking at all of the data and than narrowing in on the top most common 9 species and their diameters.\nShay’s plot :\nI created this plot to examine if there was any connection between these two aspects (species and diameter) on campus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation and Exploration\n\nWhat do we learn? What further questions does this lead to?\n\n\n\nThis bar graph shows the top 9 species on campus and their smallest average and largest diameters recorded from its on campus population. We wondered if the tree size influenced how many of that species were planted on campus, and as you can see the average diameters for each of these top 9 species are on the smaller to medium side, confirming that for the most part Macalester plants more of the tree species that aren’t the largest trees. That makes sense for a college in the city. However, you can see that within these species there is a huge range of diameters between smallest and largest. So, that is why we decided to look at where the trees were located on campus to better understand the patterns of where these most popular species were planted because it’s hard to understand by strictly looking at numbers.",

    "text": "Across Campus\n\nAfter exploring these diameters and the relations to the species we wanted to learn more about how species are planted across campus. To do this we wanted to explore the trees in their place and positioning around Macalester’s campus. As shown in the map below, Trees are planted across Macalester’s campus - the map displays the trees on campus and if you hover over each the species will be shown. Additionally, if you want to explore by species further, you can select each of the Top 9 species you want to see and each has a different color.\n\n\n\n\nSeeing all the trees on campus and their various species, we learn that there are some patterns. Certain species appear to be planted more around campus while others are very spread out without patterns. There are so, so many different species of trees planted around campus, which is so cool. The boundaries of campus are lined with trees. Continuing this exploration it would be interesting to explore when various trees were planted, and see if there are further patterns!",

However, I think that these ideas are still applicable in our setting. Teamwork is defined as how people interact with each other, and how individual skills and attributes are combined in an effective way. One key noted is that other things can impact teamwork took: outlook, attitudes, and the structure of the space. The purpose of a team and teamwork is to achieve a shared goal. Another thing that the article noted is that teamwork looks different in different settings but communication is key.\nMy biggest takeaways from the article were to have clear, concise, and effective communication. Setting goals, timelines, and the end product very clearly defined. Utilizing these pieces me and my partner can achieve our end result.",

Does the sizing of the trees play any role in this? Because it is possible that if a tree species is very small than it could skew the number of them that are planted on campus because they take up lots of or very little room.\n\nCodetrees |&gt;\n  summarize(smallest = min(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`), medium = mean(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`), largest = max(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  smallest medium largest\n     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      0.2   9.98    57.8\n\n\n\nCodetrees |&gt;\n  select(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`, SPECIES)|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`))|&gt;\n  head(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   `Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)` SPECIES         \n                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           \n 1                             57.8 American elm    \n 2                             47.6 Northern catalpa\n 3                             47.5 Silver maple    \n 4                             45.3 Hackberry       \n 5                             45   Silver maple    \n 6                             44.5 American elm    \n 7                             44   Hackberry       \n 8                             43.2 Green ash       \n 9                             42.7 Northern catalpa\n10                             40.5 American elm    \n\n\n\nCodetop_9_species &lt;- trees |&gt;\n  filter(SPECIES %in% c(\"White spruce\",\"Crabapple\",\"Silver maple\",\"Hackberry\", \"Sugar maple\",\"Honey locust\",\"Norway maple\",\"American elm\",\"Red maple\"))|&gt;\n  select('Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)',SPECIES)\n\n\n\nCodespecies_counts &lt;- top_9_species |&gt;\n  count(SPECIES, name = \"Count\")\n\n\n\nCodesum_top_9 &lt;- top_9_species |&gt;\n  group_by(SPECIES) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    \"smallest diameter\" = min(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`),\n    \"average diameter\" = mean(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`),\n    \"largest diameter\" = max(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`),\n    .groups = \"drop\")\nstr(sum_top_9)\n\ntibble [9 × 4] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ SPECIES          : chr [1:9] \"American elm\" \"Crabapple\" \"Hackberry\" \"Honey locust\" ...\n $ smallest diameter: num [1:9] 2.62 0.5 1.6 3.5 1.83 1.54 2.44 1.78 3\n $ average diameter : num [1:9] 19.77 6.25 12.61 12.55 10.91 ...\n $ largest diameter : num [1:9] 57.8 20.2 45.3 23.6 30.7 ...\n\n\n\nCodesum_top_9_long &lt;- sum_top_9 |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(`smallest diameter`, `average diameter`, `largest diameter`),\n               names_to = \"Type\",\n               values_to = \"Diameter\")\n\n\n\nCodesum_top_9_long &lt;- sum_top_9_long |&gt;\n  left_join(species_counts, by = \"SPECIES\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Type = factor(Type, levels = c(\"smallest diameter\", \"average diameter\", \"largest diameter\")),\n    SPECIES = fct_reorder(SPECIES, Count, .desc = TRUE))\n\n\n\nCodeggplot(sum_top_9_long,aes(x= SPECIES, y = Diameter, fill = Type))+\n  geom_col(position = position_dodge())+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(title =\"Campus Trees Diameter by Species\", x = \"Species (top 9)\", y = \"Diameter at Breast Height (inches)\", fill = \"Measurement Type\", caption = \"Data from Macalester Tree Inventory Drive (LAST UPDATED JULY 2024)\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggiraph)\n\n\n\nCodelibrary(dplyr)\ntrees_clean &lt;- trees %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Memorial))\n\n\n\nCodetrees_clean |&gt;\n  select(SPECIES, Memorial)\n\n# A tibble: 38 × 2\n   SPECIES           Memorial                                             \n   &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;                                                \n 1 Japanese maple    Jimm Crowder                                         \n 2 American sycamore Reid McLean ‘72                                      \n 3 Sugar maple       Paul Pellowski                                       \n 4 White oak         Entrepreneurship and Career Task Forces 2018-2022    \n 5 Crabapple         James Wallace Heritage Society                       \n 6 White oak         Marissa Shu-Hui Leow                                 \n 7 Norway maple      Dr. O.T.

    "text": "This was how they structured there data exploration :\n\nFraming the Core Question\n\n\nThe article starts by posing a clear hypothesis: Uber has taken a significant number of rides from traditional yellow taxis in Manhattan. This sets the foundation for a comparative, data-driven exploration.\n\n\nData Sources Used\n\n\nThey use open NYC taxi data and Uber’s own trip data, which were made publicly available due to city regulations. Key details:\nYellow taxi trip records from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)\nUber pickup data, also from TLC, for a comparable time period\nThis data includes timestamps, pickup locations (by neighborhood or lat/long), and trip counts.\n\n\nSpatial Focus\n\n\nThey limit the scope of analysis to Manhattan south of 96th Street, the core area for both yellow taxi and Uber activity. This geographic filtering:\nFocuses the analysis on the most competitive region\nEliminates noise from less relevant boroughs or areas with low taxi/Uber activity\n\n\nComparative Time Series Analysis They charted:\n\n\nYellow taxi pickups by month, showing a decline over time\nUber pickups by month, showing a corresponding rise\nThis comparison helped visualize the shift in ridership over time.\n\n\nHeat Maps and Spatial Trends\n\n\nThey presented pickup density maps comparing Uber and taxi usage:\nShowed where Uber is replacing taxis\nHighlighted overlapping service areas and gaps\n\n\nPatterns\n\n\nThey analyzed hourly and daily usage patterns, showing:\nDifferences in peak hours\nWhich service dominates at different times of day\n\n\nInteractivity and Visual Design The article used:\n\n\nInteractive charts and sliders to let readers explore the data\nSimple visual comparisons to emphasize trends\nClear labeling and consistent color schemes\n\n\nInterpretation and Causality\n\n\nThey avoid overly deterministic claims about causality. Showed clear trends but acknowledged\nOther factors could contribute (e.g., consumer preferences, ease of hailing via app)\nCorrelation doesn’t always mean direct causation\n\n\nContextual Commentary\n\n\nThey enrich the data story with quotes from experts and historical context, providing:\nPolicy implications\nThe economic impact on taxi drivers and medallion holders.",

They then answered their overall question by summarizing their learnings and pointing out flaws in their data process (“does not show the full picture”) or ways to improve their study.",
