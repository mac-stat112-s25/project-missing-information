    "text": "Teamwork - It makes the dream work!\nThe article I read was called the Nine Characteristics of great teamwork by Steve Hogarty.\nClik here to vist the article!\nThis was an article that focused on teamwork in a more corporate or work setting. However, I think that these ideas are still applicable in our setting. Teamwork is defined as how people interact with each other, and how individual skills and attributes are combined in an effective way. One key noted is that other things can impact teamwork took: outlook, attitudes, and the structure of the space. The purpose of a team and teamwork is to achieve a shared goal. Another thing that the article noted is that teamwork looks different in different settings but communication is key.\nMy biggest takeaways from the article were to have clear, concise, and effective communication. Setting goals, timelines, and the end product very clearly defined. Utilizing these pieces me and my partner can achieve our end result.",

Does the sizing of the trees play any role in this? Because it is possible that if a tree species is very small than it could skew the number of them that are planted on campus because they take up lots of or very little room.\n\nCodetrees |&gt;\n  summarize(smallest = min(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`), medium = mean(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`), largest = max(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  smallest medium largest\n     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      0.2   9.98    57.8\n\n\n\nCodetrees |&gt;\n  select(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`, SPECIES)|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`))|&gt;\n  head(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   `Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)` SPECIES         \n                              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           \n 1                             57.8 American elm    \n 2                             47.6 Northern catalpa\n 3                             47.5 Silver maple    \n 4                             45.3 Hackberry       \n 5                             45   Silver maple    \n 6                             44.5 American elm    \n 7                             44   Hackberry       \n 8                             43.2 Green ash       \n 9                             42.7 Northern catalpa\n10                             40.5 American elm    \n\n\n\nCodetop_9_species &lt;- trees |&gt;\n  filter(SPECIES %in% c(\"White spruce\",\"Crabapple\",\"Silver maple\",\"Hackberry\", \"Sugar maple\",\"Honey locust\",\"Norway maple\",\"American elm\",\"Red maple\"))|&gt;\n  select('Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)',SPECIES)\n\n\n\nCodespecies_counts &lt;- top_9_species |&gt;\n  count(SPECIES, name = \"Count\")\n\n\n\nCodesum_top_9 &lt;- top_9_species |&gt;\n  group_by(SPECIES) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    \"smallest diameter\" = min(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`),\n    \"average diameter\" = mean(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`),\n    \"largest diameter\" = max(`Diameter at Breast Heigh (DBH)`),\n    .groups = \"drop\")\nstr(sum_top_9)\n\ntibble [9 × 4] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ SPECIES          : chr [1:9] \"American elm\" \"Crabapple\" \"Hackberry\" \"Honey locust\" ...\n $ smallest diameter: num [1:9] 2.62 0.5 1.6 3.5 1.83 1.54 2.44 1.78 3\n $ average diameter : num [1:9] 19.77 6.25 12.61 12.55 10.91 ...\n $ largest diameter : num [1:9] 57.8 20.2 45.3 23.6 30.7 ...\n\n\n\nCodesum_top_9_long &lt;- sum_top_9 |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(`smallest diameter`, `average diameter`, `largest diameter`),\n               names_to = \"Type\",\n               values_to = \"Diameter\")\n\n\n\nCodesum_top_9_long &lt;- sum_top_9_long |&gt;\n  left_join(species_counts, by = \"SPECIES\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Type = factor(Type, levels = c(\"smallest diameter\", \"average diameter\", \"largest diameter\")),\n    SPECIES = fct_reorder(SPECIES, Count, .desc = TRUE))\n\n\n\nCodeggplot(sum_top_9_long,aes(x= SPECIES, y = Diameter, fill = Type))+\n  geom_col(position = position_dodge())+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(title =\"Campus Trees Diameter by Species\", x = \"Species (top 9)\", y = \"Diameter at Breast Height (inches)\", fill = \"Measurement Type\", caption = \"Data from Macalester Tree Inventory Drive (LAST UPDATED JULY 2024)\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodelibrary(ggiraph)\n\n\n\nCodelibrary(dplyr)\ntrees_clean &lt;- trees %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Memorial))\n\n\n\nCodetrees_clean |&gt;\n  select(SPECIES, Memorial)\n\n# A tibble: 38 × 2\n   SPECIES           Memorial                                             \n   &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;                                                \n 1 Japanese maple    Jimm Crowder                                         \n 2 American sycamore Reid McLean ‘72                                      \n 3 Sugar maple       Paul Pellowski                                       \n 4 White oak         Entrepreneurship and Career Task Forces 2018-2022    \n 5 Crabapple         James Wallace Heritage Society                       \n 6 White oak         Marissa Shu-Hui Leow                                 \n 7 Norway maple      Dr. O.T.

    "text": "What this project will entail!\n\nTrees at Mac, is a project done by Ashlyn and Shaylee exploring the trees of Macalester, their species, diameters, positions, and whether or not they are memorials. We will be doing some analysis to determine ages, and other related information regarding their health. We want to play around with a spatial project, allowing an interactive user experience. The inspiration for our project comes from wanting to explore the area around us and learn a little more about the trees that we see almost every day.\n\nImplementation Plan:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nWhat we are Doing & Day/Topic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4/7- Brainstrom\n4/9 - Crafting\n4/11 - Work\n\n\nW11\n\nCome up with ideas\nFinalize\n\n\nDue: Proposal\nDue: Case Study\n\n\nDue: Teamwork Reading\nFinalize –&gt; plan\n\n\n\n\n4/14 - Comms\n4/16 - Work\n4/18 - Work\n\n\nW12\n\nMutate and work with data\n(Ash will not be in class)\n\n\nBegin building website\n\n\nStarting building website out\n\n\n\n\n4/21 - Work\n4/23 - Work\n4/25 - Work\n\n\nW13\n\nWork on website\n\n\nPresentation Creation\n\n\nFinalize presentation and website\n\n\n\n\n4/28- Present\n4/30- Present\n5/2- Final Edits\n\n\nW14\nPresented\n\nEdits\n\n\nReport Creation\n\n\n\n\n5/5\n5/7\n5/9\n\n\nW15\n\nFinalize Report\n\n\nRecord Video\n\nDONE\n\n\n\n\nEnd Results and Goals:\n\nThe final result and goals of our project are to both gain a greater understanding of the trees on Macalester’s campus as well as grow our personal data skills. By experimenting and exploring new types of packages and applications in R we are able to grow our Data Science skills. Through our exploration and analysis we are able to begin to understand and learn about the trees of Macalester, the patterns of growth of the various species planted, as well as any patterns or trends associated with their planting.",

    "text": "Professional Reports :” “NYC Ubers” observations : - Uber has significantly increased its pickups in Manhattan, largely by replacing taxi pickups in the core areas. - Despite the large shift between Uber and taxis in Manhattan, the total number of pickups in Manhattan’s core remained mostly unchanged. - Outside of Manhattan, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens, both Uber and taxi pickups increased. - Overall, total pickups for Uber, yellow cabs, and green cabs in New York City increased from 48 million to 51 million between the comparable April-June periods (listed under Uber + Cabs)\n\nstructurally the way they organized this report is by showing how much change has occured, then exploring why there has been such a large increase (are ubers supplementing or replacing cabs?), and then dividing that sub question into two parts Uber data spatially and taxi cab data spatially. They then answered their overall question by summarizing their learnings and pointing out flaws in their data process (“does not show the full picture”).",
