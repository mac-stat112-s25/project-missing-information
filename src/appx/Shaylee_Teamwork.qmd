My biggest takeaway from the article was that effective teamwork truly stems from effective communication if the other person doesn't hear what you want to do or how you feel about something than they aren't able to create a product that you will like. You have to be extremely open and actively over communicate on your ideas and thoughts, that is what will make a group project successful.
